To use the [oauth-implicit](oauth-implicit.html) demo, you'll need to start an HTTP server with the port number 3000 on the root directory of this repository.

If you install node's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), just type in:

    http-server -p 3000

If you are using Python 2, you can go about doing this with:

    $ cd /path/to/snoocore-examples
    $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
    $ Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3000..
